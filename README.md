The six steps of data analysis in Google Data Analytics are:

1. Ask Questions: Define objectives and formulate relevant questions.
2. Prepare Data: Gather, organize, and clean data.
3. Process Data: Organize, filter, and transform data for analysis.
4. Analyze Data: Explore and infer from processed data to extract insights.
5. Share Insights: Communicate results clearly to stakeholders.
6. Act on Insights: Develop action plans based on analysis results.

I have to say that I love the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. HIGHLY recommendation. I miss the studying time when my wife was pregnant and gave birth to our daughter. I often searched for related information during my spare time from work. Those memories are truly precious.
